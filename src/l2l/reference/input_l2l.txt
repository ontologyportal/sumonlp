SentenceId:1
Weather UNK_noun_1 can be used to UNK_verb_1 or UNK_verb_2 climate change .
SentenceId:2
Weather describes the atmospheric conditions at a specific place at a specific point in time .
SentenceId:3

SentenceId:10
UNK_noun_1 gases , such as carbon dioxide and UNK_noun_2 , occur naturally in small amounts , but they are very efficient at absorbing heat energy .
SentenceId:11
For this reason , a small change in carbon dioxide can have large UNK_noun_1 on the climate system .
SentenceId:12

SentenceId:13
Carbon naturally cycles through biological , physical , and geological systems over time .
SentenceId:14
The amount of carbon on UNK_LOC_1 is stable .
SentenceId:15

SentenceId:17
Both the ozone hole and global warming are UNK_verb_1 by human activities .
SentenceId:18
However , the ozone hole and global warming are different issues .
SentenceId:19
The ozone hole is a depletion of the atmosphere ’s ozone layer , which reduces the UNK_noun_1 of the ozone layer to protect the UNK_LOC_1 from the UNK_noun_2 ’s ultraviolet UNK_noun_3 .
SentenceId:20
The hole is caused by the release of UNK_noun_1 , or chlorofluorocarbons .
SentenceId:21
Unlike reflected UNK_noun_1 which is absorbed as heat , ultraviolet UNK_noun_1 is not a large UNK_verb_1 UNK_noun_2 to the average increase in global surface temperature .
SentenceId:22
UNK_noun_1 spray UNK_noun_2 are a large UNK_noun_3 to global warming .
SentenceId:23
UNK_noun_1 spray UNK_noun_2 once contained UNK_ORG_1 ’s as a UNK_noun_3 , but not since the UNK_noun_4 when we UNK_verb_1 aware of the damage to the ozone layer .
SentenceId:24
If we stop UNK_noun_1 from making holes in the ozone layer , we could reduce global warming .
SentenceId:25
The major element for making holes in the ozone layer is a type of chemical called UNK_noun_1 , chlorofluorocarbons .
SentenceId:26
UNK_noun_1 do not make holes in the ozone layer and the ozone layer holes are not the cause of global warming .
SentenceId:27
We can completely reverse or solve climate change with the right solutions .
SentenceId:28
The residual time for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere UNK_verb_1 UNK_noun_1 to believe that global warming will UNK_verb_2 to occur due to recent UNK_noun_2 gas emissions even if immediate and significant action is taken to UNK_verb_3 these emissions .
SentenceId:29
If we can UNK_verb_1 climate change UNK_noun_1 strategies , we do n’t need to UNK_verb_2 about UNK_verb_3 to UNK_verb_4 changes .
SentenceId:30
Or , if we UNK_verb_1 on how to UNK_verb_2 to UNK_verb_3 climate changes , we do n’t need to change our behaviors using UNK_noun_1 strategies .
SentenceId:31
Solutions should consider both UNK_noun_1 and adaptation strategies so that we can reduce climate change UNK_noun_2 as much as possible and UNK_verb_1 for UNK_verb_2 changes that can not be UNK_verb_3 .
SentenceId:32
If climate changes , forests can just move to the right UNK_noun_1 .
SentenceId:33
While migration is a reasonable possibility for some UNK_noun_1 , UNK_noun_2 will be UNK_verb_1 by human - caused changes in the UNK_noun_3 that prevent plants and animals from extending their ranges .
SentenceId:34
There are no UNK_noun_1 that all of the organisms that make a functional forest ( e.g. , UNK_noun_2 , insects , microorganisms ) will UNK_verb_1 together .
SentenceId:35
In addition , seed UNK_noun_1 UNK_verb_1 by UNK_noun_2 and is fairly limited for most trees .
SentenceId:36
Because trees grow slowly and may not reproduce for many years , they are less likely to be able to UNK_verb_1 their ranges rapidly enough to UNK_verb_2 negative UNK_noun_1 from climatic conditions .
SentenceId:37
If climate changes occur quickly and variably , existing ecosystems will be less likely to UNK_verb_1 and some tree UNK_noun_1 may be lost .
SentenceId:38
Even when successful migration occurs , it may be many UNK_noun_1 before the forest achieves the same age and size distribution associated with a particular forest type .
SentenceId:39
Plants release oxygen , not carbon dioxide .
SentenceId:40
Or if they do release carbon dioxide , they only respire in the UNK_noun_1 .
SentenceId:41
Plants UNK_verb_1 carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the day , store it in sugar molecules , and then continually break down those sugar molecules to create energy in the form of a chemical compound called UNK_noun_1 ( UNK_noun_2 UNK_noun_3 ) .
SentenceId:42
UNK_ORG_1 is then used to build and maintain complex structures such as UNK_noun_1 , UNK_noun_2 , bark , and leaves from the simple sugars made in UNK_noun_3 .
SentenceId:43
The process of UNK_verb_1 sugars ( UNK_noun_1 ) releases carbon , which returns to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
SentenceId:44
This occurs throughout the day and night .
SentenceId:45
Animals need oxygen , and plants need carbon dioxide .
SentenceId:46
Plants require carbon dioxide , but they also need oxygen during the process of UNK_noun_1 .
SentenceId:47
Generally , plants release more oxygen as a UNK_noun_1 of UNK_noun_2 than the amount they use to respire .
SentenceId:48
UNK_noun_1 plants in particular use more carbon dioxide than they release .
SentenceId:49
Gases are not UNK_noun_1 or they do n’t have mass .
SentenceId:50
Anything that has UNK_noun_1 has mass .
SentenceId:51
Frozen , compressed carbon dioxide is called dry ice and has mass .
SentenceId:52
Gases have mass , too , just less than UNK_noun_1 or liquids ( by volume ) because the molecules are farther apart .
SentenceId:53
The food broken down for energy leaves an animal ’s body entirely through its urine and feces .
SentenceId:54
Much of the substance of food leaves the animal as UNK_verb_1 carbon dioxide , which is a UNK_noun_1 of energy - producing cellular UNK_noun_2 .
SentenceId:55
UNK_noun_1 produces energy , rather than converting energy .
SentenceId:56
UNK_noun_1 converts energy from UNK_CARDINAL_1 form to another .
SentenceId:57
Energy is used up during biological processes .
SentenceId:58
Gases such as carbon dioxide lack sufficient mass to UNK_verb_1 to the development of biomass in plants .
SentenceId:59
Plants get mass from the soil .
