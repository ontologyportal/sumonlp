Here's the rephrased argument:  The KBmanager was successfully initialized with the correct configuration, loading and deserializing all necessary serialized data, including SUMO_NLP.kif and Merge.kif. This process took zero total initialization time in seconds, indicating a seamless integration of the different components of the system. Furthermore, the WordNet module was successfully initialized and verified to have its 'disable' attribute set to 'true'. With the KBmanager properly set up, the TPTP3ProofProcessor class can now parse and process TPTP3 proof files according to user specifications, whether in forward style or as an E proof.
