The D216 road leads to Port-d'Envaux. Two chateaus are found along this route. The 18th-century Panloy chateau sits on a hillock. This location overlooks a curve in the Charente river. Another chateau, Crazannes, is nearly adjacent to Panloy. Crazannes is partially hidden by intricate Gothic sculptures.
